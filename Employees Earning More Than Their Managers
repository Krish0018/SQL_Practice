Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.

    from employee a,employee b

    where a.ManagerId = b.Id
    and a.salary>b.salary
