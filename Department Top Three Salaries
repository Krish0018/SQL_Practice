A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.


Solutions:
          select department.name as 'Department', e1.name as 'Employee', e1.salary as  'Salary'
                  from employee e1
                  join department 
                  on e1.departmentId = department.id

          where 3 > (SELECT
                      COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
                  FROM
                      Employee e2
                  WHERE
                      e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                          AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
