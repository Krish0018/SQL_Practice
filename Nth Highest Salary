Table: Employee

| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.


Solution: 
     select salary from
        (select salary, 
          dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as rnk
          from employee) temp_table
          where rnk = n
          limit 1
